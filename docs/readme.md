Generel functionality
the project gives the user the chance to create it's own list. But alredy the blueprint for that, the datastructure is costumizable. The Key-Schema only defines, how keys are stored. It is used to let the User create its own Value-Schema. By default the Value-Schema is empty and gets defined with every item in the Key Database.
For that there is a strong need of generelization in the frontend.
